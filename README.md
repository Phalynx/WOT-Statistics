### Development
WOT Statistics will allow you to monitor your progress in World Of Tanks. It will show you detailed information regarding your statistics. You can easily see which area's you need to focus on to make improvements in your game. 
WOT Statistics will update after every battle showing you the results. It also has a built in efficiency calculator which updates after every game. The application supports FTP uploads, which means that clans leaders/commanders can track their players stats after every battle.

NJSaaiman created WOT Statistics with the help of vBAddict's Dossier-2-JSON Project. Since early 2014 he has no more time for the further development. NJSaaiman talked with Phalynx about this topic and Phalynx offered him to take care about this Application. In April 2014, Phalynx released the WOT Statistics v2.5 to the public.

To speed up development Phalynx released the source code to the public in July 2014.
